            <h1>Video on Demand (VOD)</h1>
            <p>ACAM announces that we have installed new VOD equipment in our Avon studio to allow us to offer viewers Video On Demand on any internet viewing device. Now you will be able to see shows where ever you want, and when ever you want to see them.</p>
            <p>VOD Shows are indicated in the schedules with a <span>GREEN ARROW.</span>You can click on the program listing and the video will come up for you to click on to watch. You can also search for a particular show off the schedule, and if that program is set up as a VOD program, you can watch that as well.</p>
            <p class="italics">NOTE: VOD Programs started in August, 2016, so older programs have not been set up as VOD programming. If there is an older program that you would like to see the VOD option added, or have any questions about VOD, please email ACAM at: avoncable@yahoo.com﻿﻿</p>

            <p>Our locally produced shows are done by local town residents. Do you have an idea to add to one of our existing shows, or an idea for a new show, let us know.</p>
